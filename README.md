Description:
    
    The Chill King has grown too chill and relaxed and has tired of the heavy weight of his frozen crown. 
    He has sent out a challenge! Any magi who can reach him shall receive the Crown of Frostâ€¦     
    
    BUT THERE'S A CATCH.
    
    Any aspirant must prove their chill nature by NOT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE! 
    The lands of the Kingdom of Cold are hostile and dangerous, but its people are peaceful. 
    A good regent must prove their worthiness for the crown by displaying a nature predisposed to the principles of Chill. 
    They must dodge danger and show a light hand when dealing with those who would impede them. 
    The Kingâ€™s Subjects will throw obstacles in your wayâ€¦

    ARE YOU UP TO THE CHILLENGE?

    GENRE: BULLET HELL
